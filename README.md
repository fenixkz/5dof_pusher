# Reinforcement learning environment - 5 degree-of-freedom planar robot pushing an object.

### Project overview
This project contains the neccessary files to run the reinforcement learning (RL) experiments. The environment is designed with the OpenAI Gym guideline. 
The objective of the experiment is to push the box to the maximum distance without losing a contact with it. Everything is spawned in Gazebo simulation engine.
